### Comprehensive MySQL Database Management Tutorial

#### Introduction
This tutorial is for beginners, focusing on essential MySQL operations: connecting to the server, creating users and databases, managing tables, adding and querying data, and more.

#### Part 1: Connecting to MySQL Server
```bash
mysql -u username -p -h server_hostname_or_IP -P port_number
```
- Replace `username`, `server_hostname_or_IP`, and `port_number` with your specific details.

#### Part 2: Creating a New User
```sql
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
- Choose a secure `password`.

#### Part 3: Granting User Permissions
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Part 4: Creating a New Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE accounting_firm;
```

#### Part 5: Selecting the Database
```sql
USE accounting_firm;
```

#### Part 6: Creating Tables
- **Invoices Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE invoices (
      InvoiceID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      AccountBalance DECIMAL(10,2),
      Item VARCHAR(255),
      PurchaseDate DATE,
      Address VARCHAR(255),
      ClientID INT
  );
  ```

#### Part 7: Adding Data to the Table
```sql
INSERT INTO invoices (AccountBalance, Item, PurchaseDate, Address, ClientID) 
VALUES 
(1500.00, 'Laptop', '2023-01-15', '123 Main St, Anytown', 1),
(750.50, 'Office Chair', '2023-01-20', '456 Elm St, Anytown', 2);
```

#### Part 8: Querying Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM invoices;
```

#### Part 9: Show All Databases
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

#### Part 10: Show All Tables in the Current Database
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

#### Part 11: Show All Users
```sql
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
```

#### Part 12: Show Grants for a User
```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'newuser'@'%';
```

#### Additional Topics and Best Practices
